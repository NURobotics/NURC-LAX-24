# LAX 2023 - 2024

Contains code for the Lacrosse Robot for the 2023 - 2024 academic year. 

## Requirements

Install dependencies using

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

It's a good idea use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to do this in a virtual environment.

Portions of the code are based on: https://github.com/ozur1/SocialDistancingDetector. To run these portions, first run the bash script to download the needed weights and labels.
